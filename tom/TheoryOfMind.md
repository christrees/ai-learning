## Entropy drives complexity
Interesting thought from [Sean Carroll - The Big Picture - tc36:28](https://youtu.be/2JsKwyRFiYY?t=2188) that even time is an entroy vector. 
Another good one [[Sean Carroll - The Big Picture - tc41:03](https://youtu.be/2JsKwyRFiYY?t=2463) The purpose of life is to Hydrogenate Carbon Dioxide (Michael Russell).  That early earth the carbon atoms were in the form of carbon dioxide which happens to be relatively low entropy.  The apearance of life could DEPEND on the fact that entropy tends to increase.

## Buddhist Scholor and Theoretical Physicist
Sean Carroll talks about discriptional Layers [Sean Carroll - The Nature of Reality - tc7:38](https://youtu.be/pLbSlC0Pucw?t=458) eludes to the fact that layers must be compatible, but can devise working theories in the language of the layer to describe the nature ?
Alan Wallace brings up the point of sematical knowlege (information) effects the viewpoint, but that sematical (mind) has not been examinted [Alan Wallace - The Nature of Reality - tc33:17](https://youtu.be/pLbSlC0Pucw?t=1997)
