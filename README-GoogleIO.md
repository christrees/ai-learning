# Google-IO-2018

I wanted to research TensorFlow so...

1. Watch - [Get started with TensorFlow's High-Level APIs (Google I/O '18)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&v=tjsHSIG8I08)
  * [Try TensorFlow with zero install](https://goo.gl/NrJAEz)
  * [Train your first neural network with just 10 lines of code](https://goo.gl/6SRkzf)
  * [Use the same Keras-compatible API with TensorFlow.js!](https://goo.gl/ZBbzJH)
  * [Learn more about ML](https://goo.gl/36baeH)
  * [At time 38:19](https://youtu.be/tjsHSIG8I08?t=2299)
     * [Try TensorFlow with zero install](https://colab.research.google.com)
     * [Train your first neural network in ~10 lines of code](https://github.com/tensorflow/workshops)
     * [Use the same Keras-compatiable API with TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org)
     * [Learn more about ML](https://ai.google/education)
 2. READ - [Deep Learing with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python)
   * [Chapter 1 - online](https://livebook.manning.com/#!/book/deep-learning-with-python/chapter-1/1)
     * Machine Learning (ML) is about Rules generation based on Data and Answers INPUT.
     * Deep learning is about the depth of the Model (how many input transformation layers)
     * Deep network - multistage infromation distillation operation (info going through filters)
     * The transformation implemented by a layer is parameterized by its weights
     * Learning means finding a set of values for weights of all layers such that the network will correctly map example inputs to the 'correct' targets
     * __Loss / objective function__ - Compute a distance score
     * __Optimizer__ - Backpropagation algorithm that feed new Weights based on the Loss Score
     * __Probabilistic modeling__ - Naive Bates assumes features in input data are all independent 
     * __LeNet__ - Bell Labs - Yann LeCun historical start of the Backpropagation algorithm
     * __Kernel methods or Support Vector Machine (SVM)__ - Bell Labs Vapnic and Cortes - find good decision boundaries (a separation hyperplane) or maximizing the margin
     * SVM is a shallow method
     * Decision trees - flowchart-like structures to classify input data
     * Random Forest algorithm - build large number of spec decision trees then ensembling outputs (second-best algo for shallow ML)
     * Gradient Boosting Machines - iteratively training new models that specialize in addressing the weak points of previous models
     * 2011 - Dan Ciresan from IDSIA - GPU-trained deep neural networks - ImageNet challenge
     * __Convnets__ - Deep convolutional neural networks
     * Deep learning automates feature engineering
     * [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions) - ML Algo's
   * [Chapter 2 - online](https://livebook.manning.com/#!/book/deep-learning-with-python/chapter-2/)
     * it's locked... so moving on
   * [Chapter 3 - online](https://livebook.manning.com/#!/book/deep-learning-with-python/chapter-3/)
     * it's locked... so moving on
   * [Chapter 4 - online](https://livebook.manning.com/#!/book/deep-learning-with-python/chapter-4/)
     * it's locked... so moving on
